My tribute page for Will Ferrell
============

I chose Will Ferrell because he's my favourite actor, I learnt a lot of new skills related to **Github**, **Git**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Markdown** while making this tribute page

The most difficult part was cloning the repository and adding in the code to Visual code Studio when completing the tribute page, it took me longer than expected. 
However, I've now learnt how to:

* Clone a repository 
* Edit the HTML and CSS files 
* Save paths and view code on web browser
* Add, commit and push changes on Visual code Studio
